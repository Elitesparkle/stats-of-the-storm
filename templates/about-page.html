          If you found a bug with the parser, please include the replay file that caused the error with
          your report! The release builds have the development console enabled (Ctrl+Shift+i), so please also check if there are any
          errors displayed there when reporting bugs.</p>

          Stats of the Storm uses Blizzard's <a href="https://github.com/Blizzard/heroprotocol">heroprotocol</a> as its parser, and
          gets talent and hero information and images from <a href="https://github.com/heroespatchnotes/heroes-talents">heroes-talents</a>.

        <div class="ui inverted horizontal divider">Change Log</div>
        <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.2.1</h3>
        <p>Draft Stats: hotfix for pre-2.0 (client version 2.25.0) replays missing draft pick and ban data.</p>
        <p>Correctly applied player game threshold to Player Details with/against player tables.</p>
        <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.2.0</h3>
        <p>
          Version 0.2.0 brings talent builds and the full draft data to Stats of the Storm, along
          with a few changes that improve the general performance of the app. Since the draft data is contained
          in the replay file itself, you'll have to re-import your replays to use the new features. Unfortunately you'll
          have to do that any time the parser backend changes, so I'll try to keep those changes to a minimum.

        <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/92">#92</a> Parser: Added draft order. Parser is now at Version 2. Note: To use this feature you have to re-import your matches. Pick order stats are now shown on team summary pages and the Collection Stats: Heroes page. Thanks to /u/SlapJack1337 on Reddit for showing me where this data is.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/93">#93</a> Allow re-import of duplicate</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/87">#87</a> Match Details: Shows time per talent tier for each team. Additionally, team summaries show average time per talent tier.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/59">#59</a> Heroes: Added build stats, which display talent combinations and win rates. Available on Player summary pages and overall hero stat pages.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/88">#88</a> App: Any menu that lets you select a player now has a threshold of required matches in the database. This improves the general performance of the app. This is adjustable in settings.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/issues/91">#91</a> Collection Stats: Players: Changing the focued hero data requires users to click the search button in the filters tab. Accidentally changing that menu's values could lead to an app hang with large databases.</p>
        <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.1.2</h3>
        <p>Parser: Corrected an issue where kills were incorrectly attributed to "Nexus Forces" (and also corrected an occasional crash).</p>
        <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.1.1</h3>
        <p>Teams: Corrected issue where players could not be added to teams with the Add Player button.</p>
        <h3 class="ui inverted dividing header">Version 0.1.0</h3>
        <p>This is the first public release of Stats of the Storm. See the <a href="https://ebshimizu.github.io/stats-of-the-storm/">project page</a> for a full list of features in this release.</p>
