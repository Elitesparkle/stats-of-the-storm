# Features
Stats of the Storm is a Heroes of the Storm replay parser that uses a local database to
create detailed match summary reports, player performance reports, and overall
hero statistics for your database. 

Stats of the Storm can also be used to create reports detailing team performance (with
a team defined as 2 or more players), and organize matches into collections to represent
different divisions in a league.

Check out what Stats of the Storm can do:

* [Parsing Your Matches](#parser)

## Download
Stats of the Storm is a Windows-only application right now. You can download the latest build
from the [Releases](https://github.com/ebshimizu/stats-of-the-storm/releases) page.

Once you install the program, you can start parsing your own matches, or explore
a database created by someone else. An example of this has been created for
Phase 1 of the 2018 HGC, and instructions can be found [here](external-db.md).
