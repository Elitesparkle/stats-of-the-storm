Stats of the Storm is a Heroes of the Storm replay parser that uses a local database to
create detailed match summary reports, player performance reports, and overall
hero statistics for your database. 

Stats of the Storm can also be used to create reports detailing team performance (with
a team defined as 2 or more players), and organize matches into collections to represent
different divisions in a league.
