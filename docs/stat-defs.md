# Stat Definitions

The following is a list of stats and their definitions. Not all stats are listed, just ones that may need some additional explanation.

### Takedown
A Kill or an Assist. Granted to heroes upon an enemy hero death if the hero has damaged the dead hero within a short time, or are near the enemy hero when they died.

### Kill
Got the last hit that killed a hero.

### Assist
A Takedown (but not the last hit).

### Kill Participation
Percentage of total takedowns the unit participated in. This is [Takedowns] / [Total Team Takedowns]. Note that this may sometimes be over 100%, if heroes like Murky, D.Va, or the Lost Vikings are in play due to some odd counting of fractional takedowns.

### KDA
Ratio of Takedowns to Deaths. This is [Takedowns] / [Deaths].

### Vengeances
Internal stat, used for awards. Number of times this hero killed an enemy hero that recently killed an allied hero (I think).

### Time Dead %
[Time Dead] / [Match Length in Seconds]

### Deaths While Outnumbered (DWO)
Number of times the hero died while outnumbered. This may be due to a gank, or they were possibly the last unit standing in a team fight.

### Escapes
Internal stat. Number of times a hero escaped with little health or escaped from an attempted gank? Not actually 100% sure how the game defined an escape.

### Team Fight Escapes
Same as Escapes but specifically from team fights. Team fights are defined internally.

### Damage per Minute (DPM)
[Hero Damage] / [Match Length in Minutes]

### Physical Damage
Physical damage dealt to all units (not just heroes).

### Ability Damage
Ability damage dealth to all units (not just heroes).

### Damage per Death
Damage dealt to heroes per death. [Hero Damage] / [Deaths]

### Team Fight Hero Damage
Damage dealt to heroes in team fights.

### Siege Damage
[Structure Damage] + [Minion Damage] + [Summon Damage]

### Summon Damage
Damage dealt to summons (from Zagara, Nazeebo, etc.).

### Creep Damage
Damage dealt to mercenary camps. Once captured, damage to mercs counts as Minion Damage.

### Healing Per Mintue
[Healing] / [Match Length in Minutes]

### Healing Per Death
[Healing] / [Deaths]

### Team Fight Healing
Healing done during team fights.

### Damage Soaked
This is [Damage Soaked] - [the sum of HP at time of Death]. I remember reading this from Blizzard at one point, but it's been a while.

### Damage Taken per Death
[Damage Taken] / [Deaths]

### Team Fight Damage Taken
Damage taken in team fights.

### CC Time
Total time that CCs that are not roots, silences, or stuns applied to enemy team. Slows are included as CC.

### Stun Time
Counts sleep as a stun.

### Time on Fire
Only relevant for matchmade games. Time a hero had the flames border around their portrait.

### Experience per Minute (XPM)
[Experience Contribution] / [Match Length in Minutes]

### People Per Kill (PPK)
Team Stat. Number of heroes involved in a takedown on average.

### Mercenary Uptime
Team stat. Percentags of the match length that at least one captured mercenary was active for a team. Note that sappers will probably have a low uptime, due to them blowing themselves up.

### Time Per Talent Tier
Team stat. Length of time a team spent at each talent tier.

### End of Game Level Differential
Team stat. Difference in levels relative to the team at the end of the game. Additional stats for games where the team won and lost are provided.

### Round [x] %
Draft stat. Percentage of the picks where the hero was picked at round [x]. Note that round 1 includes the absolute first pick and also the two picks from the other team (that's the first round of draft).

### First Objective Win
Battleground stat. Number of times the team that got the first objective won. For Sky Temple, this is determined by the number of shots each team got. If both teams got the same amount, no team won the objective. For Warhead Junction, this is the team that launched the most out of the first 4 nukes, if both teams launched the same, no team won the objective. For Towers of Doom, this is the team that won 2/3 towers.

### Contested Hero
Team Details: Compare. Highlighted row in the heroes table on that page. Defined as a hero where both teams have pick %s within 10%, and pick a hero at least 25% of the time, or where one team prioritizes banning a hero that the other team picks (30% threshold for pick and ban rates).
