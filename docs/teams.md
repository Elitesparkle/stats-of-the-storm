# Teams

Teams are a way to track stats for multiple players playing on the same side. Team consist
of at least two players, and have no maximum number of players.

There are two ways to create teams in Stats of the Storm.

## Make a Team from Match Details
![Make A Team]({{ "/images/teams-01.png" | absolute_url }})

The easiest is to go to the Match
Details screen and make a team from either the blue team, or red team. Do this by selecting
the corresponding option to create or add to an existing team from the Teams menu on top.
Adding players to an existing team will add players not already on the team to the specified team.

## Make a Team from Scratch
In the Team Details page, click on the Edit menu and select New Team. 

![Make A Team]({{ "/images/teams-02.png" | absolute_url }})

Players can now be added to the team using the Add Player button. You can also edit the team name
and delete the team from the Edit menu in Team Details.
