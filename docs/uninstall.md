# Uninstalling Stats of the Storm

The normal Add/Remove Programs Windows system function can be used to uninstall the application.
However, uninstalling the app doesn't remove all of its user data. To fully remove the data, you can
either reset and delete the database before uninstalling, or after uninstalling, navigate to
`/Users/[your username]/AppData/Roaming` and delete the `stats-of-the-storm` folder. Be careful
not to accidentally delete anything else in there, as it might be needed by a different application
on your computer.
