# How to Use Aliases

Aliases allow you to combine stats from two different players. This is useful if you would like to combine stats for a single player from different regions (PTR/Live for instance).

To set up an alias, navigate to the player's Player Detail page. This player will be treated as the base
player. It does not matter which account is set to the base account. Edit aliases by selecting the Edit > Set Aliases
command from the menu at the top. Add all players whos stats should be combined. You may include the base player
in this list if you wish. After confirming the changes, the Player
Detail page will refresh with the newly combined stats.

Players that are aliased will not show up in __any__ part of the app. They will not
show up in player searches, team rosters, or player rankings. Base players will have an icon
next to their name in the Player Detail page. Hovering over the icon will show which 
players are aliased to that player. You can remove an alias by deleting all players in the 
Set Alias option.
