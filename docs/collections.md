# Collections

Collections are a way to organize matches in the database into separate sections.
This can be particularly useful for creating stats for divisions in leagues, or for
keeping track of a set of games that you like.

![Making Collections]({{ "/images/collections-01.png" | absolute_url }})

To make a collection, go to the Settings panel and click the New Collection button.

![Viewing Collections]({{ "/images/collections-02.png" | absolute_url }})

After entering a name for the collection, it will show up in the Collections tab.
In this tab, you can edit and delete your existing collections.
You can also automatically import matches to a collection by setting the Import
to Collection setting.

![Using Collections]({{ "/images/collections-03.png" | absolute_url }})

Collections will also show up in the Collection menu in the top right of the app.
Clicking on this menu will let you switch between collections. Setting a collection
will only use data from matches that are a part of that collection. The app will
function normally otherwise.

You may see some teams that have no matches in the collection still displayed in
some dropdown menus. Clicking on them will have no effect. This will hopefully 
be addressed in a future version.
