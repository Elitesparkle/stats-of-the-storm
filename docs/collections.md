# Collections

Collections are a way to organize matches in the database into separate sections.
This can be particularly useful for creating stats for divisions in leagues, or for
keeping track of a set of games that you like.

![Making Collections]({{ "/images/collections-01.png" | absolute_url }})

To make a collection, go to the Settings panel and click the New Collection button.

![Viewing Collections]({{ "/images/collections-02.png" | absolute_url }})

After entering a name for the collection, it will show up in the Collections tab.
In this tab, you can edit and delete your existing collections.
You can also automatically import matches to a collection by setting the Import
to Collection setting.

![Using Collections]({{ "/images/collections-03.png" | absolute_url }})

Collections will also show up in the Collection menu in the top right of the app.
Clicking on this menu will let you switch between collections. Setting a collection
will only use data from matches that are a part of that collection. The app will
function normally otherwise.

You may see some teams that have no matches in the collection still displayed in
some dropdown menus. Clicking on them will have no effect. This will hopefully 
be addressed in a future version.

To add matches to a collection, you have three options.

1. Import matches to a collection automatically with the Import to Collection
option in settings
2. In the Matches page, use the Collection menu to add all of the currently selected
matches to a collection. Note that if a match is selecetd and not displayed, it will
still be added to the collection.
3. Add individual matches in the Match Detail pages by also using the Collection Menu.

Matches can also be removed from collections by using the Collection menu on the Matches
and Match Details pages.
